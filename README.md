This project is the culmination of my thesis work, where I designed and developed a robust Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS). 
The system is tailored to detect and mitigate various types of cyberattacks effectively, leveraging both theoretical principles and practical implementation strategies.
The project was tested on a virtual network environment created using VirtualBox, simulating a range of network attack scenarios, such as Brute Force, ARP Spoofing, various Floods, Nmap Scans etc.
Key features include real-time detection, adaptive prevention mechanisms, and a modular design for scalability and customization.

Detailed instructions on setting up the system, configuring the network environment, and running the simulations can be found in the repository documentation.
